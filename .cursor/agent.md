# Agent Rules

You are implementing MVP v1 of this project.

You must follow the specifications in:
- .specify/product.md
- .specify/conventions.md
- .specify/user-stories.md
- .specify/requirements.md

Do not add features, behaviors, or architecture that are not explicitly defined in those files.

Default to MockProvider unless USE_LIVE_PROVIDERS=true.

Enforce all hard limits, cost controls, and Verify Mode defaults defined in conventions.

If a requested change is not supported by the specs, you must say so and ask for clarification before proceeding.
